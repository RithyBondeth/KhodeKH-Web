 * Routing-level session gating.

 * This checks for the presence of the refresh cookie only — it does not verify
 * any signature. That is deliberate: middleware decides *where to send someone*,
 * while real authorization is enforced by the gateway's JwtAuthGuard on every
 * request. Forging a cookie here buys you a redirect, not data.
 *
 * The refresh cookie (7d) is the session signal rather than the access cookie
 * (1d), so a user with an expired access token is still treated as signed in and
 * gets silently refreshed instead of bounced to /login.
